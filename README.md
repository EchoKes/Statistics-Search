[Background]

During my time as an intern, I was tasked to research on industry marketing trends and this meant that websites I was searching for must contain some sort of statistics. This was cumbersome and I decided to deploy a Heroku web application that is essentially a bare bone search tool which will allows users to enter any topics they want, followed by an output of all the URLs that may contain statistics.

[Project]

This was written in Python 3.9, utilising Flask framework.

PS: this was a 1 day build with no prior knowledge to how Flask framework operates and thus the results may not be as accurate as expected.
